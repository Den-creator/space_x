This test was conducted over a duration of approximately 4 and a half hours. 
There is still significant scope for enhancements to further improve user experience and functionality:

- **Support of Different Languages**: Expanding the app to support multiple languages, enhancing accessibility and user engagement globally.
- **Dark/Light Theme Support**: Implementing theme-switching features to offer users a choice between a light and dark interface, catering to different preferences and lighting conditions.
- **More Complex UI**: Upgrading the user interface to be more intricate and user-friendly, potentially increasing the appâ€™s intuitiveness and visual appeal.
- **Additional Screens and Bottom App Tab Bar**: Introducing more screens for comprehensive content coverage and a bottom app tab bar for improved navigation.
- **Custom Animations**: Developing custom animations such as loading, hero, and scroll animations to enrich the interactive experience of the app.
- **Reusable Common Cubit with Generic Type**: Implementing a common cubit that allows for generic typing, enhancing code reusability and project scalability.
